# CQRS Study Project

This is a study project focused on implementing the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern using .NET and Kafka. The project utilizes Docker for containerization, Kafka for event sourcing, and MongoDB and MSSQL Server for data storage.

## Technologies Used
- Docker: Containerization platform used to simplify the deployment and management of the project's components.

- Kafka: Distributed event streaming platform used for implementing the event-driven architecture and event sourcing.

- .NET: Framework used for developing the project's backend application.

- MongoDB: NoSQL database used for storing and querying data in a flexible and scalable manner.

- MSSQL Server: Relational database management system used for structured data storage and querying.
